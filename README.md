# Student-Point-Tracker

Student-Point-Tracker **(SPT)** is a self-hostable server side application that aims to be the management solution to schools that wish to gamify rewards for good student behavior.

SPT allows keeping track of students and their points, being able to remove or add them as needed, or in bulk. But with SPT's deep customization nearly anything is possible to ensure it works as the solution needed in your environment.

## Features

* [Point Presets](./docs/point-presets.md) allow defining quick ways to add reasons and point amounts.
* [Tasks](./docs/tasks.md) allow customizing STP's behavior, and running actions on a schedule.
* [Google OAuth](./docs/google-oauth.md) for sign in of Teachers and Students.
* [Configure](./docs/configuration.md) almost every aspect of STP's internal behavior.
* [Point Chips](./docs/point-chips.md) for accessing common point amounts.
