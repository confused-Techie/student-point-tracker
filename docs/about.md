# About Student-Point-Tracker (SPT)

The server side application SPT is an application that aims to help school administration encourage students to behave and preform in their time at school.
Although obviously, this application cannot do this by itself, it's intended purpose is to facilitate the teachers and administration in maintaining this effort.

As gamification becomes ever present in life, it seems this has extended to keeping track of performance and behavior at schools, where in the instance that inspired this project, one such school found success in attributing points to students. Such as they arrive for the day, they get a point, they get detention they lose a point, etc. But as the method for tracking and managing all of this information was given to office staff, the solution created originally was a large complex spreadsheet. Which very well could work depending on your school size, and other factors, but in our case the website would crash client side, and required increasing time allowances to maintain and keep working. At this point it was obvious some sort of CRUD system was needed.

This application does everything possible to be partial to the dynamic setup of schools, and the various requirements they may have, while still delivering on this core experience.

With deep customization, even as far as fully custom time based tasks with full access to the internal API.
